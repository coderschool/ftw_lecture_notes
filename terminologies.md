# FTW Terminologies

## A

- **Absolute length units (CSS)**: fixed to a physical length.

- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of subroutine definitions that describe how to use or interact with a system. Traditionally, this includes method names and parameters (in the case of a programming language) or URLs and query parameters (in the case of an HTTP API).

## B

- **Block HTML element**: A block-level element occupies the entire width of its parent element (container), thereby creating a “block.”
- **`box-sizing: border-box`**: change the box model so that the borders and the paddings are no longer added to the total width or the total height that we specify for a box.
## C

- **Child combinator `A>B` (CSS)**: Matches element B that is a child of element A.

- **client-side**, **server-side** applications: These terms are used to indicate which machine is doing the processing. Client-side applications run on the user’s machine (also referred to as the frontend), while server-side applications and functions use the processing power of the server computer (the backend).

- **Compound selector `A, B`**: Matches elements A and B.

- **CSS**: Cascading Stylesheets is the code that you use to style your website.

## D

- **Declaration (CSS)**: is a single rule which specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.

- **Descendant combinator `A B` (CSS)**: Matches B only if it is descendant of element A.

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: DNS allows us to refer to servers by their domain name. Matching the text domain names to their respective numeric IP addresses is the job of a separate **DNS server**. If you think of an IP address as a telephone number, the DNS server would be the phonebook.

- **DOM (Document Object Model)**: The document structure, the way elements follow each other or nest within one another, creates relationships between elements. DOM is also the foundation upon which we add presentation instructions with style sheets and behaviors with JavaScript.

## E

- **Embedded style sheets (CSS)**: are placed in a HTML document via the **style** element. The **style** element must be placed in the **head** of the document

- **External style sheets (CSS)**: The external `.css` file that contains a number of style rules. The `.css` document is then linked to the HTML documents. This is the most powerful and preferred method for attaching style sheets to content.

## F

- **float (CSS property)**: **Floating** an element moves it to either the left or right side as far as possible. The following siblings will **wrap around** the floating element. This layout is common in newspapers and magazines, so floats were added to CSS to achieve this effect.

## G
## H

- **HTML**: HyperText Markup Language. HTML is used to create electronic documents (pages) that are displayed on the Web.

- **HTML Attributes**: additional values that configure HTML elements and adjust their behavior.

- **HTML Element**: A building blog that makes up the structure of a web page, consists of tags and content.

- **HTML Nesting**: when an element lives inside on another element.
- **HTML Tag**: used to create HTML elements.

- **HTTP**: HyperText Transfer Protocol

- **HTTPS**: The Secure Web Protocol ("S" stands for "secure") is a modification of HTTP that encrypts form information when it is sent between the user’s client and the server. Any web page that has form fields that accept text (such as a search bar or a login) should use HTTPS.

## I

- **IP address (Internet Protocol)**: Every computer and device (router, smartphone, car, etc.) connected to the internet is assigned a unique numeric **IP address**.

- **Inline HTML element**: An inline-level element only occupies the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.

- **Inline styles (CSS)**: Applying properties and values to a single element by using **style** attribute in the element itself.

## J
## K
## L
## M
## N

- **Next-sibling combinator `A+B` (CSS)**: Matches element B that immediately follows element A, where A and B share the same parent.

- **Normalize CSS**: Normalize CSS in order to make cross browser reset (every browser render the page in exact same way).

## O

- **Open Source**: Open source software is developed as a collaborative effort with the intent to make its source code available to other programmers for use and modification. Open source programs are usually free to use.

## P

- **position (CSS property)**: Positioning is a way to specify the location of an element anywhere on the page with pixel precision. Values: `static` | `relative` | `absolute` | `fixed` | `sticky`.

- **Properties (CSS)**: are the way you can style an HTML element.

- **Property value (CSS)**: is one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example there are many `color` values, like `red`, `blue`, etc.)

## Q
## R

- **Relative length units (CSS)**: specify a length in relation to something else.

- **Responsive Web Design (RWD)**: is a strategy for providing appropriate layouts to devices based on the size of the viewport (browser window).

## S
- **Selector (CSS)**: defines the element(s) to be styled.

- **servers**: The computers that make up the internet. Because they “serve up” documents upon request, these computers are known as **servers**. The role of server is to wait for a request for information, and then retrieve and send that information back as quickly as possible.

- **Subsequent-sibling combinator `A~B` (CSS)**: Matches element B that is preceded by A, where A and B share the same parent.

## T
## U

- **User Interface (UI)**: is the presentation of a product, how it looks and feels.
- **URL**: Every page and resource on the web has its own special address called a **URL**, which stands for **Uniform Resource Locator**.

## V

- **viewport**: the browser window.

## W

- **web**: originally called the **World Wide Web(www)**, is just one of the ways information can be shared over the internet. It allows documents to be linked to another via **hypertext** links thus forming a huge "web" of connected information.
