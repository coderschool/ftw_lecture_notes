# FTW Terminologies

## A
## B

- **Block HTML element**: A block-level element occupies the entire width of its parent element (container), thereby creating a “block.”

## C

- **client-side**, **server-side** applications: These terms are used to indicate which machine is doing the processing. Client-side applications run on the user’s machine (also referred to as the frontend), while server-side applications and functions use the processing power of the server computer (the backend).

- **CSS**: Cascading Stylesheets is the code that you use to style your website.

## D

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: DNS allows us to refer to servers by their domain name. Matching the text domain names to their respective numeric IP addresses is the job of a separate **DNS server**. If you think of an IP address as a telephone number, the DNS server would be the phonebook.

- **DOM (Document Object Model)**: The document structure, the way elements follow each other or nest within one another, creates relationships between elements. DOM is also the foundation upon which we add presentation instructions with style sheets and behaviors with JavaScript.

## G
## H

- **HTML**: HyperText Markup Language. HTML is used to create electronic documents (pages) that are displayed on the Web.
- **HTML Attributes**: additional values that configure HTML elements and adjust their behavior.
- **HTML Element**: A building blog that makes up the structure of a web page, consists of tags and content.
- **HTML Nesting**: when an element lives inside on another element.
- **HTML Tag**: used to create HTML elements.
- **HTTP**: HyperText Transfer Protocol
- **HTTPS**: The Secure Web Protocol ("S" stands for "secure") is a modification of HTTP that encrypts form information when it is sent between the user’s client and the server. Any web page that has form fields that accept text (such as a search bar or a login) should use HTTPS.

## I

- **IP address (Internet Protocol)**: Every computer and device (router, smartphone, car, etc.) connected to the internet is assigned a unique numeric **IP address**.

- **Inline HTML element**: An inline-level element only occupies the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.

## O

- **Open Source**: Open source software is developed as a collaborative effort with the intent to make its source code available to other programmers for use and modification. Open source programs are usually free to use.

## P
## Q
## R

- **Responsive Web Design (RWD)**: is a strategy for providing appropriate layouts to devices based on the size of the viewport (browser window).

## S

- **servers**: The computers that make up the internet. Because they “serve up” documents upon request, these computers are known as **servers**. The role of server is to wait for a request for information, and then retrieve and send that information back as quickly as possible.

## T
## U

- **URL**: Every page and resource on the web has its own special address called a **URL**, which stands for **Uniform Resource Locator**.

## V
## W

- **web**: originally called the **World Wide Web(www)**, is just one of the ways information can be shared over the internet. It allows documents to be linked to another via **hypertext** links thus forming a huge "web" of connected information.
