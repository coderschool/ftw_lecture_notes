Given this HTML structure:

```html
<div id="assignment1">
  <h1 class="header">About Project Gutenberg</h1>
  <p id="para1">Project Gutenberg is an online library of free eBooks.</p>
  <p>
    Project Gutenberg was the first provider of free electronic books, or
    eBooks. Michael Hart, founder of Project Gutenberg, invented eBooks in 1971
    and his memory continues to inspire the creation of eBooks and related
    content today.
  </p>
  <h1 class="header">Project Gutenberg Mission Statement</h1>
  <p>To encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks.</p>
  <p>
    A 2004 essay by Michael Hart provides more detail on the mission statement,
    and some of the beliefs that guide Project Gutenbergâ€™s activities in
    fulfillment of that mission.
  </p>
</div>
```

- Change the color of all `<p>` elements, example `#2c3e50`.
- Change the color of the element with ID `para1`, example `#2ecc71`.
- Change the color of class `header`, example `#e67e22`.
- Change the background color of all `<h1>` elements, example `linen`.
- Pick one pattern in [CSS3 Patterns](http://projects.verou.me/css3patterns/) and apply to the background of the page, example _Lined paper_.
- With the font property: Set the <p> to "italic", "20px" and "Verdana".
- Make the first letter of each paragraph 200% bigger and has different color, example `#27ae60`.
- Hide the first `<h1>` element. It should still take up the same place as before. Hint: `visibility`.
- Hide the first `<h1>` element. It should not take up any space. Hint: `display`.
